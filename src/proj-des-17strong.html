          <h3>Usability Research</h3>
          <h4>Demographics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Young college student in Hamilton: unsure where to go after school, could hear a different perspective and also what someone values when considering leaving the city</li>
            <li>Long-time Hamilton resident and employee within the city: has interest in local history but isn’t very involved with any city initiatives, can provide perspective on younger generation and more effective call-to-actions for engagement</li>
            <li>Older, small-business owner and long-time resident: invested in community activities and local history. Owns a local business in the German Village: vested interest in local success and may have unique business insights.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Procedure</h4>
          <p>Individuals were given a brief overview through a consent form, asked some pre-and post-observation questions, then asked for additional comments and feedback. Participants were told to focus on takeaways and call-to-actions of the brochure.</p>
          <h4>Sample Questions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Have you heard about the 17Strong initiative?</li>
            <li>How do you identify yourself as someone from the area?</li>
            <li>What does the city mean to you?</li>
            <li>How are you currently involved with your community?</li>
            <li>What do you think is the purpose of this pamphlet?</li>
            <li>What did you learn from this pamphlet?</li>
            <li>Were there any parts that felt confusing?</li>
            <li>Are you interested in getting involved with 17Strong?</li>
            <li>What suggestions would you give regarding this pamphlet’s:</li>
            <ul class="noBotMar">
              <li>overall design?</li>
              <li>content?</li>
              <li>call to action?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>After reading this, what else would you like to learn about Hamilton?</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Missing call-to-action for audience members</li>
            <li>Condensing information about neighborhoods</li>
            <li>Adding more relevant information and a “human” touch</li>
            <li>Create better flow of content. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In general, participants of the interviews had no previous knowledge or experience with 17 Strong, and all encouraged stronger marketing tactics. A uniting digital and physical presence (overall branding) of the initiative would help the image.

          <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          <p>Through usability findings and research, a new brochure was created with the following elements.</p>
          <h4>Imagery</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>17 Strong logo: a new logo is proposed for 17 Strong, the “7” shaped like a map of Hamilton, Ohio. This fits the initiative’s brand and purpose (uniting Hamilton while celebrating its neighborhoods) distinguishing the logo from the City of Hamilton’s logo while keeping a similar font and color scheme. Text is bigger for ease of reading.</li>
	          <li>Standalone images: Images were chosen to signify Hamilton’s social community with bright colors and lively subjects (could be replaced by more activity-based images).</li>
	          <li>Neighborhood map: map was changed to place more focus on each neighborhood, color-coded based on the neighborhood types, and given actual pictures of neighborhood features based on usability feedback.</li>

          </ul>
          <h4>Copy</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Introduction is condensed for easy reading and focuses on overall goals and purpose
              <li>Micro-grant program: new micro-grant section is added to advertise opportunities for community engagement with examples and instructions for individuals who are interested in making an impact on their community</li>
              <li>Resources: new section for resources is added for people who are interested in different areas of the city--may prove a handy section for reaching out to organizations and staying involved</li>
              <li>Hamilton blurb: a quick blurb about the city was added to vary content and add uniting information before splitting off to address the distinctions of each neighborhood</li>
              <li>Neighborhood blurb: neighborhood section was condensed based on user feedback, keeping important elements while leaving more room for brochure call-to-actions.</li>
              <li>Get involved: new section was added per client request and user feedback detailing different ways general Hamilton residents can get involved with the community.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Future Direction</h4>
          <p>17 Strong should consider revisiting their brand, and focus on different channels (marketing) to reach Hamilton residents. 17Strong can leverage powerful, word-of-mouth growth as there are so many people and organizations it is involved with, especially carrying forward the micro-grant program. </p>
