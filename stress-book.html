								<h2>What is Stress?</h2>
								<p>Biologically speaking, stress is the inability for an organism to cope with its environment.
								Because response to immediate surroundings is its highest priority, reproduction and other body functions take a back seat
								—in fact, high stress has been linked to fertility problems in animal studies.
								 One study suggests that the increased infertility in dairy cows is linked to environmental stress;
								 clearly, stress should be minimized <sup>1</sup>.</p>

								<p>However, stress isn’t harmful on its own.
								Stress responses have evolved through temporary “fight or flight” tactics that help animals avoid imminent danger;
								this response affects the entire body, increasing heart rate, energy production, muscle tension, blood-clotting, and reaction time among other things <sup>2</sup>.
								Trouble appears when stress lasts longer than it’s meant to, upsetting the body’s homeostasis (balance) for an extended period.
								As hunter-gatherer dangers have largely disappeared from today’s society, stress manifests differently in the modern world.
								Considering social roles, research suggests stress levels affect the nature and quality of an individual’s work,
								and that self-esteem, love from others, serve as protective factors against stress <sup>3</sup>.</p>

								<h2>Definitions</h2>
								<p>The concept of stress can be broken into several elements.
								Firstly, stress can be created from outside;
								external demands are things that require an individual’s attention to the surrounding environment.
								Stressors are stimuli that create stress within an individual.
								These are combated through coping strategies, or efforts to deal with stress.
								When stress becomes so potent these techniques no longer work, an individual is in a state of crisis, or distress.
								Several types of stress are commonly recognized<sup>4</sup>.</p>

								<p><b>Acute Stress</b></p>
								<p>Acute stress is the most common form of stress, occurring from immediate stressors that can be overwhelming in large doses.
								Emotional (anger, irritability, anxiety, depression) and physical (tension, headache, back pain, jaw pain) symptoms are common.
								Acute stress is short-term and highly manageable<sup>5</sup>.</p>

								<p><b>Episodic Acute Stress</b></p>
								<p>Episodic acute stress may stem from disorder and self-inflicted demands/pressures;
								individuals are constantly over-aroused, short-tempered, and tense with nervous energy.
								Interpersonal relationships may deteriorate, and the workplace often becomes stressful.
								Treatment may requires professional help and many months of gradual changes<sup>5</sup>.</p>

								<p><b>Chronic Stress</b></p>
								<p>Chronic stress is the “daily grind” that happens in the background, physically and mentally draining.
								Chronic stressors may include early trauma never addressed, an unhappy marriage, a dysfunctional family, or an unsatisfactory job.
								Although chronic stress is deadly (a factor in suicides and heart attacks), individuals often become used to the circumstances and ignore them.
								Chronic stress is difficult to treat, often needing extended medical, behavioral, and stress management<sup>5</sup>.</p>

								<p><b>Key Stressor Characteristics</b></p>
								<p>People react to stressors differently.
								Some universal factors that make one stressor more serious than another include the severity, the duration, the timing,
								how closely it affects daily live, and how expected or controllable it is.
								Stressors involved in important parts of life can be highly stressful for many people,
								and an accumulation of different stressors at once also increases the pressure <sup>6</sup>.</p>

								<p><b>Who is Prone to Stress?</b></p>
								<p>Everyone faces stress, but research has identified several vulnerability factors
								that may cause predisposition to distress. Children and young adults are especially vulnerable to severe,
								indirect stressors like war and terrorism <sup>7</sup>. Environment and upbringing also play a major factor;
								children of depressed parents have been shown to be more sensitive to stress and are likelier to develop depression themselves <sup>8</sup>.
								 Research also suggests genetic makeup can contribute to stress sensitivity; the 5HTTLPR gene is linked to forming depression through stress.
								 Individuals with two short forms (s/s genotype) of the gene were likelier to develop depression in the
								face of four or more stressful life events than individuals with long forms (l/l genotype) of gene <sup>9</sup>. </p>

								<p><b>Physical and Mental Effects</b></p>
								<p>Stress takes a physical and mental toll on the body—as it turns out,
								these reactions are not mutually exclusive. We will explore the physical and mental reactions of a body in stress,
								as well as the most common stress-related physical and mental disorders: heart disease and PTSD <sup>6</sup>.</p>

								<h2>Physical Stress</h2>

								<p>The body has two distinct stress systems:
								the sympathetic-adrenomedullary (SAM) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system.
								The SAM system starts in the hypothalamus, causing a chain reaction that results in the adrenal
								glands secreting adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones circulate through the blood and
								increase heart rate, metabolizing glucose faster for “fight or flight” energy.
								The HPA system, meanwhile, stimulates the pituitary gland and results in production of
								stress hormones glucocorticoids in the adrenal cortex (cortisol in humans). This hormone is
								good in emergency situations because it represses immune response—escape is more important than
								healing, so the body’s inflammatory response is delayed.
								However, if this reaction is prolonged, cortisol can damage brain cells and stunt growth<sup>10</sup>.
								Research shows that stress can slow wound-healing by as much as 40%<sup>11</sup>.</p>

								<p>Stress takes a distinct toll on the immune system.
								Our immune system is defended by B-cells and T-cells, which are different types of lymphocytes
								(a type of white blood cell) that recognize and target antigens invading the body.
								B-cells recognize intruding antigens on their own, but T-cells depended on cytokines (small messenger proteins) to activate.
								Cytokines help mediate the immune system through pro-inflammatory (promoting) or anti-inflammatory (suppressing) immune responses<sup>12</sup>.</p>

								<p>Cytokines are vital because they send signals between the brain and the immune system.
								The immune system monitors the internal state of a body and can send information about disease and injury to the brain;
								more importantly, the brain can respond, actually influencing immune processes.
								This relationship indicates brain disorders can affect the immune system,
								and immune system problems can lead to behavioral or psychiatric problems <sup>13</sup>.</p>

								<p><b>Physical Disease with Mental Influences</b></p>
								<p>The most common stress-related physical condition is cardiovascular disease,
								which is the leading cause of death in the US <sup>14</sup>.
								Hypertension (blood vessels constricting, blood pressure rising) and coronary
								heart disease (CHD, including artery blockage) are related to increased stress;
								every-day and work-related stress can increase the risk for coronary heart disease and death <sup>15</sup>.</p>

								<p>Research suggests that people with a type A behavior pattern
								(extreme work and competitiveness, impatience, hostility) are twice as likely to develop CHD
								and eight times as likely to have reoccurring heart attacks—the hostility component of Type A
								personalities (anger, scorn, cynicism, and contempt) is most correlated with these coronary artery problems <sup>16</sup>.
								Meanwhile, type D personality types show insecurity and anxiousness, and are likelier
								to have fatal heart attacks and more problems after heart surgery<sup>17</sup>.
								Mental stress is known for raising blood pressure and epinephrine,
								and may also reduce oxygen supply to the heart muscle<sup>18</sup>.</p>

								<p>Depression is also linked with CHD.
								People with heart disease are roughly three times more likely than healthy people to be depressed;
								conversely, depression is a risk factor for development of CHD <sup>19</sup>.
								Research suggests that phobic anxiety increases the risk for sudden cardiac death,
								and that social factors play a part in the development of CHD through the mind-body connection <sup>20</sup>.</p>

								<p>Treatment for CHD and related stress include surgical procedures and medication
								(to lower cholesterol and blood clots), emotional disclosure (to confront emotional distress),
								and biofeedback (to make patients aware of physiological body response—like heart rate and
								 muscle tension—and modify them when necessary);
								 a holistic combination often provides the most beneficial results <sup>5</sup>. </p>

								<h2>Mental Stress & PTSD</h2>
								<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
								introduced a new category called trauma- and stressor related disorders, which includes PTSD,
								the most common stress-related mental disorder.
								Any extreme or terrifying life-threatening event outside everyday experiences can lead to symptoms
								like PTSD—importantly, PTSD is considered a normal response to an abnormal stressor <sup>21</sup>.
								PTSD is traditionally linked to traumatic single-event stressors like combat, rape, and natural disasters,
								but current research has also broadened the scope of PTSD to include chronic stressors like war, terrorism, and racial discrimination.
								Traumatic events through human intent are likelier to cause PTSD than non-personal
								events—the degree of direct exposure to the traumatic event has an impact<sup>5</sup>.</p>

								<p>Clinical symptoms include recurring nightmares, avoidance, mood detachment,
								and arousal and excessive reactivity, and distorted self-blame <sup>22</sup>.
								In the US, lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 6.8%, averaged from 9.7% in women and 3.6% in men <sup>23</sup>.
								Minority groups and individuals in negative or unsupportive social environments are
								likelier to develop PTSD, as well as people with preexisting depression and anxiety conditions,
								a family history of depression and anxiety, negative affect, and ineffective coping strategies <sup>5</sup>.</p>

								<p>Protective factors against PTSD include cognitive support and social strength—in the case of torture victims,
								 realistic individuals with prior knowledge and expectations of how they will be treated,
								 strong commitment to a cause (for example, political prisoners), and repeated exposure are more
								 likely to create personal narratives around their traumatic experiences, decreasing PTSD symptoms <sup>24</sup>.
								 As many PTSD-inducing events are unforeseeable, the best preventative measures include preparing people
								 for emergency situations with information and coping skills, and training people to tolerate anticipated threats.
								 Treatment for PTSD symptoms stretch to resources like telephone hotlines, psychological sessions,
								 crisis intervention, mediation, and cognitive-behavioral treatments,
								the latter proving highly effective using today’s technology <sup>5</sup></p>

								<h2>Love Your Mind; Love Your Body</h2>
								<p> As we have reviewed, stress is a biological response that enables us to adapt and build resilience for the future.
									There are many individual characteristics that can improve person’s ability to handle life stress, including <sup>5</sup>:
									<br/><br/>
									-higher levels of optimism<br/>
									-greater psychological control or mastery <br/>
									-increased self-esteem <br/>
									-better social support<br/>
									-emotional regulation<br/>
									<br/>
									Most importantly, we have to keep in mind that the body and the mind are linked;
									to have a healthy, balanced life, you have to take care of both aspects of yourself.
									Live and enjoy the human experience.</p>
