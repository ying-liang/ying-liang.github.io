<p>
    This website contains my ever-evolving portfolio currently housed using <b>Github Pages</b> as a static site, under a custom domain name through <b>Namecheap</b>. 
    Coded during my free time, Iâ€™ve learned a lot of modern web design principles along the way. 
    This site was created using <b>HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS</b>. 
    <b>Google Analytics</b> has been implemented on the main pages. 
    <b>Static site form submission</b> is powered through a custom-styled Google Form. 
    All HTML pages are currently housed at the root directory level. Dev-friendly source code can be found in the <b>"src"</b> folder. 
    <b>Gulp.js task runner</b> is used to optimize content from source folder (minify HTML/CSS/JS, reduce image sizes) before pushing changes to the repo. 
    My site design philosophy revolves around <b>modern technology, responsive design, and accessibility for all.</b>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Modern Technology</b>
    <ul>
        <li>High performance and security</li>
        <li>Technical debt reduced by only supporting modern browsers</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Responsive Design</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimal device breakpoints (min. 320px screen)</li>
        <li>Relative CSS units and repetitive CSS variables </li>
        <li>Media queries for reduced motion</li>
        <li>Meta data implemented for social sharing</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Accessible for All</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Semantic, descriptive HTML</li>
        <li>Color contrast checked</li>
        <li>ARIA implemented, meeting WCAG AA guidelines</li>
        <li>CSS classes for screen reader/visual impairment</li>
    </ul>
