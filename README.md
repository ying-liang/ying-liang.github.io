<p>This website contains my ever-evolving portfolio currently housed using <b>Github Pages</b> as a static site. Coded during my free time, Iâ€™ve learned a lot of modern web design principles along the way. This site was created using <b>HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS</b>. <b>Google Analytics</b> has been implemented on the main pages. <b>Static site form submission</b> is powered through a custom-styled Google Form. <b>Gulp.js task runner</b> is used to optimize web content before pushing changes to the repo. My site design philosophy revolves around <b>modern technology, responsive design, and accessibility for all.</b></p>
