    This website contains my ever-evolving portfolio currently housed using <b>Github Pages</b> as a static site. Coded during my free time, Iâ€™ve learned a lot of modern web design principles along the way. This site was created using <b>HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS</b>. <b>Google Analytics</b> has been implemented on the main pages. <b>Static site form submission</b> is powered through a custom-styled Google Form. <b>Gulp.js task runner</b> is used to optimize web content before pushing changes to the repo. My site design philosophy revolves around <b>modern technology, responsive design, and accessibility for all.</b>

<p>
    <b>Modern technology</b>
    <ul>
        <li>- High performance and security</li>
        <li>- Technical debt reduced by not supporting old browsers like IE</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Responsive design</b>
    <ul>
        <li>- Minimal device breakpoints (min. 320px screen)</li>
        <li>- Relative CSS units and repetitive CSS variables </li>
        <li>- Media query formants for devices and reduced motion</li>
        <li>- Meta data implemented for social sharing</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Accessible for all</b>
    <ul>
        <li>- Keyboard navigable</li>
        <li>- Semantic, descriptive HTML</li>
        <li>- Color contrast checked</li>
        <li>- ARIA implemented, meeting WCAG AA guidelines</li>
        <li>- CSS classes for screen reader/visual impairment</li>
    </ul>
</p>
